# python-api-challange
# WeatherPy
# I started by gathering weather data for ~600 cities around the world. I added this data into a dataframe and then plotted the relationships between the cities latitude and various weather data points.
# I then computed the linear regression for each relationship and split it up between northern and southern hempisphere coordinates. 
# VacationPy
# I plotted each of the cities from WeatherPy on a heat map with the humidity providing the weight.
# Using the Google Places API, I was able to determine the nearest hotel to the cities that matched my weather preferences. I added a marker on those cities with the hotel information.
